title: Some decent recipes that I make now and then

### Some recipes I like

Some of these are just links to recipes online, others I've been taught or
adapted. For my own recipes, most of the seasonings don't have real measurements
(yet), because I tend to just season by taste. I'm not yet sure what the "best"
amounts are for a lot of it, but will be editing this periodically with more
specific amounts and other recipes.

### 1. [Japanese Chicken Curry](https://www.justonecookbook.com/simple-chicken-curry/)

#### Notes

- I usually just buy boxed roux from the grocery store. "Golden Curry" is my preference. 
- You can substitue whatever vegetables you want in here, it's a pretty
  forgiving recipe.
  
### 2. [Shephard's Pie](https://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/alton-brown/shepherds-pie-1942900)

### 3. Pasta + Chicken + Cream Sauce

#### Ingredients

- 2 cloves garlic (but really, as much as you're comfortable with)

  on all sides to cook on medium high heat. When just cooked through, remove the
  chicken.

- Turn the heat down to medium, add cream and broth, spices, cheese. Stir it
  occasionally and wait for it to thicken a bit
- Add garlic and cook until fragrant (~1 min).
- Add spinach and tomatoes and stir. Let the spinach wilt.
- Add the chicken back. 
- Serve over pasta

#### Notes

- You can sub in just about any other vegetables you have on hand.

- Add the noodles to the vegetables. Add light soy sauce, and hoisin sauce to taste.

#### Notes

I rarely make the thing here twice. You can throw in any vegetables you like. I
will also sometimes scramble an egg or two in the wok just before adding the
noodles.

### 5. Brussel Srouts

#### Ingredients
- Brussel Sprouts - as many as you want to eat
- 2 slices of bacon
- Olive Oil
- Garlic
- Salt, course
- Pepper
- Balsamic Vinegar

#### Instructions

- Remove the base of each sprout, cut in half
- Cut the bacon into pieces about an inch long. 
- Cook the bacon in a cast iron pan, medium high heat
- Remove bacon, any bits. You can either leave some of the grease, or completely clean and add some oil.
- Turn the heat up to high
- Add brussel sprouts, salt them a bit. Stir occasionally, until they are nicely browned.
- Mix in garlic, balsamic vinegar, mustard.
- Drop the heat a bit and cook until they are soft all the way through (but not mushy).
- Add cooked bacon, pepper, and some flaky finishing salt to taste.

#### Notes

- Depending on the size of the brussels, you may want to finish them in the oven
  at 375 F. I do this if they are large, it will just cook them through
  without burning them.

### 6. Shrimp Scampi

#### Ingredients 

- 1 lb or so of peeled shrimp
- 1 bag (4 servings or so) of fresh pasta
- [optional] two shallots cut thin
- 2 tsp butter
- 1/4 cup of dry white wine
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- black pepper
- fresh parsley, chopped
- garlic, minced

#### Instructions

- heat olive oil over medium heat
- [optional] Cook shallots
- Add shrimp, garlic, salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes, cook until pink (just a few minutes, don't overcook!)
- Add some butter, white wine. Reduce for just a few minutes.
- Take it off heat. Garnish with parsely and cheese. Serve over pasta

#### Notes

- This recipe is super fast. I like to keep shrimp in my freezer, as it's a very
  convenient protien that's fast to thaw and cook on week nights.
- You can add any other vegetables you like to it, just cook them ahead of the
  shrimp since they cook so fast.

### 7. The easiest bread recipe that's actually good

As someone who likes to bake bread a lot, this recipe is almost
discouraging in how little effort it takes to make a good basic bread.

[This bread recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread)
doesn't involve any kneeding, is as simple as bread can get, and is actually
quite good!
